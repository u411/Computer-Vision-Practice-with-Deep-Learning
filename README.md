# HW1 Object Detection for Occupational Injury Prevention

## Project Description
This project implements an object detection model to identify and localize objects in images for occupational injury prevention. The model is trained on a dataset with 17 object categories and outputs bounding boxes and classifications for each detected object. The goal is to fine-tune a transformer-based model, DETR (DEtection TRansformers), and achieve high performance on the validation and test sets.
