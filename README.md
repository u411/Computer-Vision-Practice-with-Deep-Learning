# HW1 Object Detection for Occupational Injury Prevention

## Project Description
This project implements an object detection model to identify and localize objects in images for occupational injury prevention. The model is trained on a dataset with 17 object categories and outputs bounding boxes and classifications for each detected object. The goal is to fine-tune a transformer-based model, DETR (DEtection TRansformers), and achieve high performance on the validation and test sets.

# HW3 Text-to-Image Generation with GLIGEN

## Project Description
This project generates high-quality images based on textual prompts, bounding box annotations, and optional reference images. The workflow consists of generating prompts, refining them, and creating images using the GLIGEN pipeline, followed by evaluating the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) for quality assessment.
